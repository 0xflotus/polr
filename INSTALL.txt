INSTALLING POLR

Steps: 

 - Make sure your MySQL server is set up and accessible. 
 - Create the database that you wish to use with Polr
 - Set the Character Set of your database to UTF8. Although Polr does this for you each time your site is accessed, 
   this should be set through MySQL to prevent certain SQL injection attacks.
 - Create a user that you wish to use with Polr. It should have all permissions during the installation.
 - Fill in the fields and finish the installation.
 - If you have any troubles, it is probably due to your MySQL database. Set "$debug" to 1 in `req.php`, delete `config.php`,
   and try to install again. MySQL will show what errors are causing the problem.
 - Additionally, please read the README.md file for troubleshooting, requirements, and more.
